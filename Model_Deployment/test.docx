The following steps refer to Google's official tutorial: https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/tflite-android-tutorial.
However, this tutorial is not complete, in other words, it cannot work, so we decided to provide a more comprehensive one.

1.	Train a model through AutoML on GCP and you will get an ‘xxx.tflite’ model and an ‘xxx.txt’ labels files.
Training tutorials at https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/tutorial. 
 

2.	Download the android application demo:
git clone https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2 
	
Enter the folder ‘./tensorflow-for-poets-2/android/tflite/app/src/main/assets’ and you will find two files: graph.lite and labels.txt
 
Replace the two files with those created by AutoML. Note to change ‘xxx.tflite’ to ‘graph.lite’ and ‘xxx.txt’ to ‘labels.txt’.

3.	Install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio 
Select “Open an existing Android Studio project” and go to the following directory path.
     

4.	Synchronize project with Gradle files.
 

5.	Set up an Android device:
https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html#enable 

6.	Connect your phone and computer with USB lines and now android studio will manage to find your device.

7.	Modify the code to run the quantized AutoML model:
Open the file ImageClassifier.java:
 

 
 
 
 

8.	Hit the triangle shape button to start downloading App.
 

9.	Launch the App on your phone and test it!!!
